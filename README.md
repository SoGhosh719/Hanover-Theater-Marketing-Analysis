## Hanover Theatre Case Study: Insights and Recommendations

## Introduction

The Hanover Theatre, a cultural landmark in Worcester, MA, is renowned for productions like A Christmas Carol. However, the theatre faces challenges in attracting younger audiences, particularly university students, due to barriers such as:

- Affordability
- Scheduling conflicts
- Cultural disconnect
 -Accessibility issues

Challenges Faced by the Theatre
1. Affordability
Ticket prices ($39–$69) exceed the budget of students who prefer options under $25.
Limited discounted offerings (e.g., sensory-friendly performances, student matinees) are not aligned with student preferences.
2. Scheduling Conflicts
Performances often clash with academic deadlines and holiday travel plans, especially for international students.
Evening shows are misaligned with public transit schedules.
3. Cultural Disconnect
Productions like A Christmas Carol may not resonate with international students unfamiliar with Western traditions.
Lack of multilingual materials and insufficient cultural diversity in programming.
4. Accessibility
Limited transportation options and inadequate disability accommodations deter attendance.
Students without personal vehicles struggle with public transit schedules.
